# Writeup - number_guesser1

## Idea

You need to guess multiple numbers in a row. You have a limited number of guesses for each number. Everytime you want to make a guess you can supply two numbers and get the information, if the number to guess is lower, higher or between your numbers.

## Implementation

Implement Ternary-Search to always guess the number within the tries you get. In `secrets.py` you can see an example solution for the ternary search.
